Recommend the ones that would be most interesting to a visitor who is a {recommend_desc}. Focus on topics that align with their interests. 

First, select the most suitable titles and prepare brief reasons why each is suitable.

Then, for the selected titles, call the 'get_links' tool to retrieve the links for those titles. The tool will return a JSON object with links or errors for each title.

Finally, format the output as markdown, with recommended titles as bullet points. Include a link to each post in the format [title](./link), where 'link' is the base name obtained from the tool. Use the following format for each recommendation:
- [Title](./link): Reason.

If a link cannot be found for a title, skip that recommendation or note it appropriately."""
